## Error Filtering 

For a given error chain `err1` - ... - `errK` - ... - `errN`,
filtering allows to remove errors from the chain to produce `err1` - ... - `errK-1` - `errK+1` - ... `errN`.

This is a draft implementation to demostrate the ease with which error filtering can be delivered under this proposal, 
but is not a complete implementation of it.
